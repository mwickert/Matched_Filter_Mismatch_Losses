# Matched Filter Mismatch Losses in MPSK and MQAM Using Semi-Analytic BEP Modeling
This repository is the future home Jupyter notebooks and Python modules for exploring matched filter mismatch losses in m-ary phase-shift keying (MSK) and m-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM). A primary dependency of this software is the package `scikit-dsp-comm` as well as the *scipy stack* packages `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`.
